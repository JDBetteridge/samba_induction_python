    "Please choose one based on the list and descriptions we provide below.\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Via Azure Notebooks</u>: We have premade a Python environment on Azure notebooks which can be accessed and cloned by anyone with a University account. If you aren't sure on the setup, this is the option to try first. **NOTE:** The university's support of Azure notebooks will end 1st Oct, 2020.\n",
    "- <u>Via a local install</u>: Python can be installed locally onto your laptop or desktop PC - Linux users should even have Python as standard. We recommend that you install Anaconda/Conda rather than just Python, as this also comes with several useful features we describe below.\n",
    "- <u>Via Google CoLab</u>: Google also hosts an online Python service which can be accessed with a live internet connection."

    "\n",

    "Naturally we recommand Anaconda unless you really don't want to use a GUI, or you will be relying on using an environment where GUIs are disabled (like on a supercomputer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed Anaconda, create a new Python 3 environment (choose the latest version of Python which should be 3.6 or 3.7) and make sure it has the following packages installed:\n",
    "- `math` (should be installed by default)\n",
    "- `sys` (should be installed by default)\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "You may also want to include `scipy` and `pandas` if you plan to use Python for your research.\n",
    "Once you have created your environment, change into it (or `activate` it in the command line) and get (Ana)Conda to install `Jupyter Notebook` and/or `spyder` in the environment.\n",
    "Anaconda users will should have clear options in the GUI to do this, once they swap to the new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now ready to begin using Python!\n",
    "Create a new folder in a memorable place on your computer for these lessons, and download and extract the following two `.zip` files in this folder:\n",
    "- [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip](../data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip)\n",
    "- [python-novice-inflammation-code.zip](../data/python-novice-inflammation-code.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have two folders `data` and `code` after extracting them.\n",
    "Naviagate into the `data` folder to begin with, and create a new Jupyter Notebook here.\n",
    "Alternatively, load up `spyder` and create a new `.py` file, and save it to this folder."
